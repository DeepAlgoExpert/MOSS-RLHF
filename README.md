## ðŸŒ  Introduction

Due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for AI researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of LLMs. The stable training of RLHF has still been a puzzle.
In this technical report, we intend to help researchers to train their models stably with human feedback.

Contributions are summarized as follows: 
1) We release competitive Chinese and English reward models, respectively, which have good cross-model generalization ability, alleviating the cost of relabeling human preference data; 
2) We conduct in-depth analysis on the inner workings of PPO algorithm and propose the PPO-max algorithm to ensure stable model training;
3) We release the complete PPO-max codes to ensure that the LLMs in the current SFT stage can be better aligned with humans.

## ðŸ”© Requirements & Setup

This repository works on Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.13.1.

We recommend using the **conda** virtual environment to run the code.

#### Step 1: Create a new Python virtual environment
```bash
conda update conda -n base -c defaults
conda create -n rlhf python=3.8
conda activate rlhf
```
#### Step 2: Install PyTorch and TensorBoard
```bash
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 tensorboard -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

#### Step 3: Install the remaining dependencies
```bash
conda install datasets accelerate safetensors chardet cchardet -c huggingface -c conda-forge
pip3 install transformers sentencepiece einops triton==1.0.0 rouge jionlp==1.4.14 nltk sacrebleu cpm_kernels

apt install libaio-dev
DS_BUILD_OPS=1 pip install deepspeed
```

## âœ¨ Start training your own model!
Run code in a few steps.

### Step 1: Recover Reward model weights
We can not directly release the full weight of the reward model because of protocol restrictions.
You can merge the diff weight with original Llama-7B to recover the reward model we used.

We upload the diff models, thanks to tatsu-lab, you can recover the reward model follow these steps:
```bash
1) Download the weight diff into your local machine. The weight diff is located at:
# For English:
# SFT model
https://huggingface.co/fnlp/moss-rlhf-sft-model-7B-en
# Reward model
https://huggingface.co/fnlp/moss-rlhf-reward-model-7B-en
# Policy model
https://huggingface.co/fnlp/moss-rlhf-policy-model-7B-en

# For Chinese:
https://huggingface.co/Ablustrund/moss-rlhf-reward-model-7B-zh/tree/main

2) Merge the weight diff with the original Llama-7B:
# For English:
# Reward model
python merge_weight_en.py recover --path_raw decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf --path_diff ./models/moss-rlhf-reward-model-7B-en/diff --path_tuned ./models/moss-rlhf-reward-model-7B-en/recover --model_type reward
# SFT model
python merge_weight_en.py recover --path_raw decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf --path_diff ./models/moss-rlhf-sft-model-7B-en/diff --path_tuned ./models/moss-rlhf-sft-model-7B-en/recover --model_type sft
# Policy model
python merge_weight_en.py recover --path_raw decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf --path_diff ./models/moss-rlhf-policy-model-7B-en/diff --path_tuned ./models/moss-rlhf-policy-model-7B-en/recover --model_type policy
# For Chinese:
python merge_weight_zh.py recover --path_raw decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf --path_diff ./models/moss-rlhf-reward-model-7B-zh/diff --path_tuned ./models/moss-rlhf-reward-model-7B-zh/recover
```
### Step 2: Select your own SFT model.
Because of some limitations, we can not release the **Chinese** SFT model (Currently).
You can use your own SFT model, or a strong base model instead of our SFT model.

### Step 3: Start training
Run the command below.
```
# For Chinese:
# You need to use your own sft model currently.
bash run_zh.sh

# For English:
# We have loaded the sft model and reward model to huggingface.
bash run_en.sh
```
