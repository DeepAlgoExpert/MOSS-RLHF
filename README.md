## ðŸŒ  Introduction

Due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for AI researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of LLMs. The stable training of RLHF has still been a puzzle.
In this technical report, we intend to help researchers to train their models stably with human feedback.

Contributions are summarized as follows: 
1) We release competitive Chinese and English reward models, respectively, which have good cross-model generalization ability, alleviating the cost of relabeling human preference data; 
2) We conduct in-depth analysis on the inner workings of PPO algorithm and propose the PPO-max algorithm to ensure stable model training;
3) We release the complete PPO-max codes to ensure that the LLMs in the current SFT stage can be better aligned with humans.

### ðŸ”© Requirements & Setup

This repository works on Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.13.1.

We recommend using the **conda** virtual environment to run the code.

#### Step 1: create a new Python virtual environment
```bash
conda update conda -n base -c defaults
conda create -n rlhf python=3.8
conda activate rlhf
```
#### Step 2: install PyTorch and TensorBoard
```bash
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 tensorboard -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

#### Step 3: install the remaining dependencies
```bash
conda install datasets accelerate safetensors chardet cchardet -c huggingface -c conda-forge
pip3 install transformers sentencepiece einops triton==1.0.0 rouge jionlp==1.4.14 nltk sacrebleu cpm_kernels

apt install libaio-dev
DS_BUILD_OPS=1 pip install deepspeed
```

### ðŸ‘‰ Start Training

TODO, To be finalised before 15. July 2023
